'석굴암(石窟庵)은 대한민국 경상북도 경주시의 토함산 중턱(진현동 891)에 있는 불국사 소속 호국암자이다.\\n국보 24호인 경주 석굴암 석굴이 있는 암자이다. 석굴암 석굴은 세계에서 유일한 인위적으로 만들어진 화강암 석굴이다. 내부에서는 보존을 위해 사진 촬영은 금지되어 있다.\\n2023년 5월 4일부터 무료입장이 가능해졌다.\\n\\n\\n== 개요 ==\\n보통 석굴암의 암(庵)자를 바위 암(岩)자로 알고. 석굴암 석굴을 동일한 용어로 쓴다. 하지만 석굴암의 암(庵)자는 암자 암(庵)자로. 석굴이 있는 암자(작은 절)를 뜻한다. 석굴암 석굴은 불상과 부속 화강암 조각이 있는 굴을 뜻한다.\\n남북국시대 751년(통일신라 경덕왕 10년)에 김대성이 만들었을 때는 석불사(石佛寺)라고 하였다. 큰 규모의 절을 한 글자로 사. 작은 규모의 절은 한 글자로 암이라고 부르므로. 창건 당시에 석굴암은 규모가 현재보다 컸던 걸로 생각된다.\\n\\n\\n== 창건 및 연혁 ==\\n『불국사고금창기(佛國寺古今創記)』를 따른다.\\n\\n\\n=== 남북국 시대 ===\\n751년(통일신라 경덕왕 10년) : 재상 김대성이 석불사(石佛寺)로 창건을 시작하였다.\\n774년(통일신라 혜공왕 10년) : 김대성이 석굴암(석불사)을 완공하였다.\\n\\n\\n=== 조선 시대 ===\\n1703년(숙종 29년) : 종열(從悅)이 중수하였다.\\n1758년(영조 34년) : 대겸(大謙)이 중수하였다.\\n조선 말기 : 울산병사 조예상(趙禮相)이 중수하였다.\\n\\n\\n=== 구한말 및 일제강점기 ===\\n1907년 : 1962년 지역 노인들의 증언에 따르면. 이때 석굴암은 조가절(趙家寺)이라고 불리며 일반인들이 향을 올리고 공양을 계속하고 있었다. 그러나 우체부가 석굴을 새로 발견한듯이 우체국장에게 보고 하였다. 일제도 이에 동조하여. 일본인들이 석굴을 훼손하고 문화재를 반출해가는 계기로 만들어 버렸다.\\n\\n\\n== 창건 이유 ==\\n\\n\\n=== 전통적으로 알려진 사실 ===\\n『삼국유사(三國遺事)』에 따르면. 김대성은 재상 김문량의 아들이다. 현생의 부모를 위해서 불국사를 창건 하였고 전생의 부모를 위해 석굴암을 창건하였다고 한다.\\n하지만 『삼국 사기(三國史記)』에는 김대성이라는 이름이 없다. 김문량의 아들로 김대정이라는 인물이 있는데. 이를 김대성과 같은 인물로 본다. 한자음은 시대에 따라 달라질 수도 있기 때문이다.\\n\\n\\n=== 음모론 ===\\n경덕왕은 아버지 성덕왕을 추모하기 위해 불국사를 크게 중창하고. 석굴암을 만들라고 재상 김대성에게 지시하였다고 한다. 석굴암은 아들 혜공왕 때. 완공이 되었다.\\n하지만 혜공 왕이 시해를 당하고. 후에 원성왕이 왕위에 올랐다. 혜공왕은 경덕왕의 아들이자 성덕왕의 손자이다. 원성왕은 성덕왕과 경덕왕의 사당까지 허물고. 자신의 할아버지와 아버지의 사당을 대신 세웠다. 순수 진골 혈통과 단절을 한 것이다.\\n원성왕의 입장에서는 경주의 대표적인 사찰인 불국사와 석굴암이 자신과 혈통이 다른 왕을 위해 만들어졌다고 남아있으면. 왕의 권위가 서지 않는다. 그래서 경덕왕의 재상인 김대성이 만들었다고 소문을 냈다고 한다.\\n사실. 불국사와 석굴암의 규모를 보면 재상이 만들었다고 보기에는 무리가 있다. 재상이 왕보다 더 화려한 사찰을 지어 자신의 부모를 추모한다면. 왕의 입장에서는 새로운 왕조 개창을 위한 사전 작업으로 볼 수 있기 때문이다.\\n\\n\\n== 경주 석굴암 석굴 ==\\n\\n\\n=== 조각상 ===\\n\\n\\n==== 본존불 ====\\n석굴암 본존불은 석가여래좌상(釋迦如來坐像)으로. 화강암에 조각하였다. 높이 약 3.4미터이다.\\n\\n모습 : 석가모니가 모든 악마의 방해와 유혹을 물리친 승리의 순간을 나타낸 것이라고 한다. 깨달음을 얻은 모습이므로 성도상이라고도 한다.\\n수인 : 오른손은 항마촉지인(降摩觸地印)이고. 왼손은 선정인(禪定印)이다.\\n백호 : 본존불의 눈썹과 눈썹사이에 있는 수정을 백호(白毫)라고 한다. 조각 당시의 백호는 유실되었고. 현재 백호는 1966년 국내산 수정을 깎아 뒷면에 순금판을 대어 복원한 것이다.\\n광배 : 석굴암은 모두 대칭이지만. 광배만 비대칭이다. 아래에서 바라볼 때. 정확한 원으로 보이게 하기 위해서이다. 160cm 높이에서 바라보면 정확한 원으로 보이므로. 당시 신라 남성의 평균신장이 160cm 내외라고 보고 있다.\\n방향 : 동짓날 태양이 뜨는 방향을 바라보고 있다고 한다.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n====

부른다.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n==== 감실상 ====\\n십대제자 조각상 위에 10개의 조그만 방이 있다. 이를 감실이라고 하는데. 속에 작은 조각상이 하나씩 안치되어 있다.\\n조각상의 종류는 유마거사상이 1개이고. 다른 보살상이 8개이다. 원래 10개였으나. 대한제국 때 일본인이 제1감실과 제10감실에 있던 조각상 2개를 반출해서 사라졌다. 지금은 그 자리에 조명이 설치되어 있다.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n====

3조각이 나버렸다고 한다. 김대성이 분을 못 이기다가 잠이 들어버렸다. 그날 밤 천신(天神)이 내려와 조각 난 덮개 돌로 천장을 만들어 놓고 갔다고 한다.\\n사진을 보면 덮개 돌이 실제로 3조각이 나 있다.\\n\\n\\n==== 석굴암 옆 굴 ====\\n석굴암 옆에 보면 굴이 있고 문무왕릉과 연결되는 길이 있다고

평가 ===\\n인도와 중국에 산을 파낸 석굴은 있으나. 석굴암처럼 화강암을 조각하여 인위적으로 건축물처럼 만든 석굴은 없다.\\n석굴암 본존불은 헬레니즘 문화의 영향을 받은 인도 간다라 미술 양식으로 만들어진 것으로 알려져 있다.\\n\\n\\n=== 논란 ===\\n문화재로서의 원형을 파악하지 않은 상태에서 훼손되었기 때문에. 그 본래의 모습에 대한 논란이 있다.\\n\\n\\n==== 바미얀 석굴의 영향을 받았나? ====\\n서울대학교 이주형 교수는 석굴암이 아프가니스탄의 바미얀 석굴에서 영향을 받았다고 주장했다.\\n바미얀 석굴과 석굴암은 공통적으로 원형평면 위에 배치가 되어있고 돔형 천장을 가지고 있다고 한다. 네모반듯한 전실. 안쪽 벽에 부조로 새겨진 조각상. 위쪽에는 감실이 있고 그 안에 보살상이 있는 점 등이 똑같다고 주장한다.\\n그리고 이 교수는 바미얀 석불의 원류가 돔 형태의 로마 판테온이라고 주장했다.\\n\\n\\n==== 빛구멍은 존재했었나? ====\\n석굴암 본존불 앞쪽 천장에 조명을 위한 빛구멍(광창)이 원래 있었다는 주장이 있다.\\n\\n\\n==== 비어있는 감실 2개에도 원래 불상이 있었나? ====\\n감실 2개가 원래 비어져 있었는지. 아니면 감실 2개에도 불상이 있었는데 반출되었는지 정확히 알 수 없는 문제가 있다.\\n\\n\\n==== 석굴암 석굴 앞에 건물이 있었나? ====\\n현재는 석굴 앞에 나무로 된 전각이 있다. 그런데 원래 석굴암 건축 당시에 석굴 앞에 나무로 된 전각이 있었느냐. 없었느냐는 논란이다.\\n조선 영조 때. 지도에는 석굴암 앞에 나무로 된 목조전실이 없었다. 하지만 이것도 창건 당시에는 다를 수 있기 때문에 정확히 알 수 없다.\\n\\n\\n==== 석굴암 본존불은 색깔을 입혔었나? ====\\n\\n석굴암 본존불은 원래 채색이 되어 있었다는 주장이다. 보통 예전 석불은 채색을 했다고는 하는데. 현재는 정확히 알 수 없다. 다만. 일제강점기에 본존불 입술을 채색했었다고 하고.

금지되어 있다.\\n2023년 5월 4일부터 무료입장이 가능해졌다.\\n\\n\\n== 개요 ==\\n보통 석굴암의 암(庵)자를 바위 암(岩)자로 알고. 석굴암 석굴을 동일한 용어로 쓴다. 하지만 석굴암의 암(庵)자는 암자 암(庵)자로. 석굴이 있는 암자(작은 절)를 뜻한다. 석굴암 석굴은 불상과 부속 화강암 조각이 있는 굴을 뜻한다.\\n남북국시대 751년(통일신라 경덕왕 10년)에 김대성이 만들었을 때는 석불사(石佛寺)라고 하였다. 큰 규모의 절을 한 글자로 사. 작은 규모의 절은 한 글자로 암이라고 부르므로. 창건 당시에 석굴암은 규모가 현재보다 컸던 걸로 생각된다.\\n\\n\\n== 창건 및 연혁 ==\\n『불국사고금창기(佛國寺古今創記)』를 따른다.\\n\\n\\n=== 남북국 시대 ===\\n751년(통일신라 경덕왕 10년) : 재상 김대성이 석불사(石佛寺)로 창건을 시작하였다.\\n774년(통일신라 혜공왕 10년) : 김대성이 석굴암(석불사)을 완공하였다.\\n\\n\\n=== 조선 시대 ===\\n1703년(숙종 29년) : 종열(從悅)이 중수하였다.\\n1758년(영조 34년) : 대겸(大謙)이 중수하였다.\\n조선 말기 : 울산병사 조예상(趙禮相)이 중수하였다.\\n\\n\\n=== 구한말 및 일제강점기 ===\\n1907년 : 1962년 지역 노인들의 증언에 따르면. 이때 석굴암은 조가절(趙家寺)이라고 불리며 일반인들이 향을 올리고 공양을 계속하고 있었다. 그러나 우체부가 석굴을 새로 발견한듯이 우체국장에게 보고 하였다. 일제도 이에 동조하여. 일본인들이 석굴을 훼손하고 문화재를 반출해가는 계기로 만들어 버렸다.\\n\\n\\n== 창건 이유 ==\\n\\n\\n=== 전통적으로 알려진 사실 ===\\n『삼국유사(三國遺事)』에 따르면. 김대성은 재상 김문량의 아들이다. 현생의 부모를 위해서 불국사를 창건 하였고 전생의 부모를 위해 석굴암을 창건하였다고 한다.\\n하지만 『삼국 사기(三國史記)』에는 김대성이라는 이름이 없다. 김문량의 아들로 김대정이라는 인물이 있는데. 이를 김대성과 같은 인물로 본다. 한자음은 시대에 따라 달라질 수도 있기 때문이다.\\n\\n\\n=== 음모론 ===\\n경덕왕은 아버지 성덕왕을 추모하기 위해 불국사를 크게 중창하고. 석굴암을 만들라고 재상 김대성에게 지시하였다고 한다. 석굴암은 아들 혜공왕 때. 완공이 되었다.\\n하지만 혜공 왕이 시해를 당하고. 후에 원성왕이 왕위에 올랐다. 혜공왕은 경덕왕의 아들이자 성덕왕의 손자이다. 원성왕은 성덕왕과 경덕왕의 사당까지 허물고. 자신의 할아버지와 아버지의 사당을 대신 세웠다. 순수 진골 혈통과 단절을 한 것이다.\\n원성왕의 입장에서는 경주의 대표적인 사찰인 불국사와 석굴암이 자신과 혈통이 다른 왕을 위해 만들어졌다고 남아있으면. 왕의 권위가 서지 않는다. 그래서 경덕왕의 재상인 김대성이 만들었다고 소문을 냈다고 한다.\\n사실. 불국사와 석굴암의 규모를 보면 재상이 만들었다고 보기에는 무리가 있다. 재상이 왕보다 더 화려한 사찰을 지어 자신의 부모를 추모한다면. 왕의 입장에서는 새로운 왕조 개창을 위한 사전 작업으로 볼 수 있기 때문이다.\\n\\n\\n== 경주 석굴암 석굴

항마촉지인(降摩觸地印)이고. 왼손은 선정인(禪定印)이다.\\n백호 : 본존불의 눈썹과 눈썹사이에 있는 수정을 백호(白毫)라고 한다. 조각 당시의 백호는 유실되었고. 현재 백호는 1966년 국내산 수정을 깎아 뒷면에 순금판을 대어 복원한 것이다.\\n광배 : 석굴암은 모두 대칭이지만. 광배만 비대칭이다. 아래에서 바라볼 때. 정확한 원으로 보이게 하기 위해서이다. 160cm 높이에서 바라보면 정확한 원으로 보이므로. 당시 신라 남성의 평균신장이 160cm 내외라고 보고 있다.\\n방향 : 동짓날 태양이 뜨는 방향을 바라보고 있다고

논란이 있다.\\n\\n\\n==== 바미얀 석굴의 영향을 받았나? ====\\n서울대학교 이주형 교수는 석굴암이 아프가니스탄의 바미얀 석굴에서 영향을 받았다고 주장했다.\\n바미얀 석굴과 석굴암은 공통적으로 원형평면 위에 배치가 되어있고 돔형 천장을 가지고 있다고 한다. 네모반듯한 전실. 안쪽 벽에 부조로 새겨진 조각상. 위쪽에는 감실이 있고 그 안에 보살상이 있는 점 등이 똑같다고 주장한다.\\n그리고 이 교수는 바미얀 석불의 원류가 돔 형태의 로마 판테온이라고 주장했다.\\n\\n\\n==== 빛구멍은 존재했었나? ====\\n석굴암 본존불 앞쪽 천장에 조명을 위한 빛구멍(광창)이 원래 있었다는 주장이 있다.\\n\\n\\n==== 비어있는 감실 2개에도 원래 불상이 있었나? ====\\n감실 2개가 원래 비어져 있었는지. 아니면 감실 2개에도 불상이 있었는데 반출되었는지 정확히 알 수 없는 문제가 있다.\\n\\n\\n==== 석굴암 석굴 앞에 건물이 있었나? ====\\n현재는 석굴 앞에 나무로 된 전각이 있다. 그런데 원래 석굴암 건축 당시에 석굴 앞에 나무로 된 전각이 있었느냐. 없었느냐는 논란이다.\\n조선 영조 때. 지도에는 석굴암 앞에

'''임페라토르 카이사르 디비 필리우스 아우구스투스(Imperator Caesar divi filius Augustus, 기원전 63년 9월 23일 ~ 서기 14년 8월 19일)는 로마 제국 초대 황제(재위 기원전 27년 ~ 서기 14년)이다. 또한 로마 제국의 첫 번째 황조인 율리우스-클라우디우스 왕조의 초대 황제이기도 하다. 본명은 가이우스 옥타비우스 투리누스(Gaius Octavius Thurinus)였으나, 카이사르의 양자로 입적된 후 가이우스 율리우스 카이사르 옥타비아누스(Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus)로 불렸다. 기원전 44년 옥타비아누스는 자신의 외할머니 율리아 카이사리스의 남동생이자 자신의 외종조부뻘인 율리우스 카이사르가 암살되자, 유언장에 따라 카이사르의 양자가 되어 그 후계자가 되었다. 기원전 43년, 옥타비아누스는 마르쿠스 안토니우스, 마르쿠스 아이밀리우스 레피두스와 함께 군사 정권인 제2차 삼두 정치를 열었다. 삼두 정치를 행한 집정관의 한 사람으로서 옥타비아누스는 효과적으로 로마와 속주[1]를 지배하였고, 세력을 모아 히르티우스와 판사가 사후 집정관에 재선되었다. 이후 제2차 삼두 정치도 깨지는데 다른 집정관이었던 레피두스는 유배되고 마르쿠스 안토니우스는 기원전 31년 악티움 해전에서 패배한 뒤 자살하였다.\n","\n","제2차 삼두 정치의 붕괴 후 옥타비아누스는 대외적으로 로마 공화국을 부활시키고 정부에 관한 권한은 로마 원로원에게 주었으나, 사실상 권력을 독점하였다. 유일한 통치자가 다스리지만 대외적으로는 공화국 형태인 정치 체제의 기틀을 다지는 데는 오랜 시간이 걸렸다. 껍데기만 공화국인 이 나라는 훗날 로마 제국으로 불린다. 황제권은 옥타비아누스 이전에 로마를 통치했던 카이사르와 술라의 독재권과는 전혀 달랐다. 옥타비아누스는 로마의 원로원과 시민들로부터 “독재권을 부여받았지만” 거절하였다.[2] 법에 따르면 ‘존엄자’(아우구스투스)라는 칭호를 받은 옥타비아누스에게 원로원은 평생 동안 권력을 가지도록 하였고 “호민관 권한”(tribunitia potestas)을 가졌으며 기원전 23년까지 집정관을 역임하였다.[3] 아우구스투스는 재정적인 성공과 원정에서 얻은 물자, 제국 전체에 걸쳐 맺은 여러 피호 관계(clientela), 군인과 재향 군인의 충성, 원로원에서 부여한 여러 권한과 명예[4] 그리고 사람들의 존경을 받아 절대적인 권력을 누렸다. 아우구스투스가 가진 로마의 정예병 로마 군단 다수를 통제할 수 있는 권한은 원로원에게 군사적인 위협이 되어 원로원의 결정을 억압하였고, 군사적 수단을 사용하여 원로원의 정적들을 제거하여 원로원이 자신에 복종하게끔 하였다.'''\n","\n","test_question2 = '''Question: 아우구스투스가 로마 제국을 통치한 기간은 얼마나
